# ImageProcessing_MATLAB
Basic image processing techniques implemented in MATLAB.

This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques implemented in MATLAB.  
The main functionalities include:

- Image inversion (negative image creation)
- Brightness enhancement with clipping
- Maximum pixel detection with coordinates
- Noise reduction using a median filter
